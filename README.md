Certainly! Here's an example PHP code that takes input from an HTML form, downloads a remote file, and saves it locally:
<?php
if (isset($_POST['url'])) {
    $url = $_POST['url'];
    
    // Generate a unique filename for the downloaded file
    $filename = uniqid() . '.pdf';
    
    // Download the file and save it locally
    file_put_contents($filename, file_get_contents($url));
    
    // Provide the file as a download to the user
    header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream');
    header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . $filename . '"');
    readfile($filename);
    
    // Delete the temporary file
    unlink($filename);
    exit;
}
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Download File</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form method="POST" action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>">
        <label for="url">https://crackingcity.net/:</label>
        <input type="text" name="url" id="url" placeholder="Enter file URL" required>
        <button type="submit">Download</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
In this code, we first check if the form has been submitted (isset($_POST['url'])). If it has, we retrieve the URL entered in the form ($_POST['url']). We then generate a unique filename for the downloaded file using uniqid() and the .pdf extension (you can change this based on the type of file you're downloading).

Next, we use file_get_contents() to download the remote file and file_put_contents() to save it locally with the generated filename. We set the appropriate headers to indicate that we're providing a file for download. We use readfile() to read the file contents and output it to the user.

After the file has been downloaded, we delete the temporary file using unlink($filename) to clean up.

The HTML form has an input field where the user can enter the URL of the file they want to download. When the user clicks the "Download" button, the form is submitted to the same PHP script ($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']), and the file is downloaded and saved locally.
